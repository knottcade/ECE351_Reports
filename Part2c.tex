In this part we learned about how to use complex numbers in Python. This includes how to read and write complex numbers in code, and how to convert them between rectangular and polar forms. Numpy allows us to also retrieve only the real part, imaginary part, or just the angle from a number as well, using numpy.real/imag/angle. This allows us to easily move back and forth between forms and easily keep track of numbers.
