The purpose of this lab was to become to more comfortable with using Anaconda and all of the tools that come along with it. Anaconda includes many powerful applications that allow us make difficult calculations in a short time, and it is driven by the Python coding language. This lab will help build a foundation that we will build off of for the rest of the semester.
