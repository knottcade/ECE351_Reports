Overall this lab was very useful to my understanding of LaTeX as well as Python. I am somewhat nervous to begin working with the programs and learn a new coding language, but this lab made me feel better in that regard. It is easy to see how useful this technology is, and I am very excited to learn how to use it. This will make time spent doing math much more effective, and writing lab reports will definitely be a better procedure than I have had in the past. I am looking forward to the following semester, and hope to learn a lot. \newline https://github.com/knottcade
