This last section of the lab provided us without a sort of shorthand reference manual for some commands that will be very helpful to us throughout the semester. There is a list of packages to use in Python that will be very helpful, along with a list of specific commands to be used when writing Python code. I am sure that these definitions will be super useful as we start getting further into the course.
