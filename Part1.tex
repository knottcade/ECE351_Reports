Part 1 of this lab was very useful in becoming familiar with the layout of Jupyter Notebook. This section of the lab included a tutorial reading on the use of Jupyter Notebook, which covered a few different areas of the notebook, especially the difference between code and markdown cells. Understanding this basic part of Notebook is key to being effective when using it. We then learned how to use proper equation formatting in LaTeX. Then we learned how to include code in our reports with the right formatting, as well as how to print documents off of Notebook. Since this class is heavily math oriented and much of our math will be calculated using Python, it is extremely beneficial to know how to include code and equations in our reports.
